           <h2>Application Process</h2>
           <p> <br>
             We enroll year-round when there is space available for children in the appropriate classroom and program. If a space is not available for the timeline you are interested in for your child, your application will be considered for the waitlist. There is no fee to join the waitlist. <br>

            To qualify for enrollment (either initially or from the waitlist) your family will need to complete an Application for Enrollment, virtual tour and the Child Visit. <br>
            
            When a space becomes available for your child, you will be emailed a decision letter. If the application was accepted, the decision letter will include: the start date, classroom, and program information. The decision letter will include a link to the final step in the enrollment process which is to pay the non-refundable Registration Fee. <br>
            
            Spaces are reserved quickly, so we ask that you be ready to pay the Registration Fee via PayPal within two business days of receiving the Letter of Acceptance. If we do not receive an answer within two business days, we will move to the next family on the list.</p>

JOIN US FOR A CHILD VISIT </h3> <p>
During this visit your child will be invited to explore with traditional Montessori materials under the guidance of the Head of School or a Lead Guide. A parent must be present during the observation. <br>

After this observation, your application for admission will be reviewed by the leadership team. For each program we aim to keep balanced communities, this includes age, gender, previous school experience, language skills, etc. A decision on your child's enrollment will be made within one week of your Child Visit and you will be notified via email. </p>
