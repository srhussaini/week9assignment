          <p>
            Maria Montessori Preschool applies the educational philosophy and methods of Maria Montessori, M.D., a renowned Italian physician and child educator. For over a century, Dr. Montessori's teaching approach has been proven and refined in cultures as diverse as those of Italy and India, The Netherlands and Mexico, Ireland and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>

            There are more than 3200 Montessori schools in the United States, 400 of which are in California.
            
            The Montessori concept of education allows children to experience the joy of learning at an early age. Intellectual, creative, physical, and social growth flourish. Each child works and learns at his own pace, and according to his own capacities in a noncompetitive atmosphere. Children of varying ages work together in the same classroom, stimulating both academic and social growth.</p>
            <p>
            Montessori recognizes the potential of the young child and strives to develop the potential of each child through a "prepared environment." Specially trained Montessori teachers and unique teaching materials are utilized. The teacher prepares the classroom, observes the children, directs activities, and offers work according the readiness and needs of each child.</p>
            <p>
            Though much has been said about the academic achievements of Montessori children, the main value of the educational method lies in the self-discipline, self-motivation, independence, and love of learning that the children achieve.
